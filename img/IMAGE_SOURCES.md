# Image Source Recommendations

Use royalty-free, industrial-themed photography with consistent color grading. Save the downloaded assets into the `img/` folder and update `img/image-manifest.json` if filenames change.

## Licensing Notes
- Prefer royalty-free sources such as Unsplash or Pexels for photography. Review and retain screenshots of the license page for record-keeping.
- Replace placeholder assets with higher-resolution originals when available. Update `img/image-manifest.json` so the manifest loader picks up the new filenames automatically.
- The brand logo should be supplied by Laxmi Dyes Industries. If a file containing "laxmi" in its name is not yet available, add it to `img/` (for example `img/laxmi-logo.png`) and update the manifest entry.
